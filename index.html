			<p>This image known as the Blue Marble has become the most reproduced photograph in all of human history, and it has changed the way that humanity has thought about our common home. It reminds us that we are all connected and that our actions have an impact on the planet. The climate crisis is now the biggest and most serious challenge that humanity has ever faced.</p>
			<p>  Let me show you some things you can personally do to contribute to lowering greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

					 <p>This pie chart represents the distribution of the different kinds of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere. Now all greenhouse gases are not created equal in terms of their effect on global warming. So climate scientist have designated GWP as a measure of the relative warming effect compared to Carbon Dioxide which is assigned a value of 1. What you see on the right is the result of scientific studies that have been done periodically.</p>

					<h2>Percent of GHG from Industrialized Agriculture</h2>
					<div id="larger-font">
					<ul>
						<li>53% of CO2 equivalent emissions of N2O (Nitric Oxide)</li>
						<li>44% of CO2 equivalent emissions of CH4 (Methane)</li>
						<li>5% of CO2 emissions</li>
					</ul>
					</div>
					<h3>From Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations</h3>
					<p>Now the amount of global warming CO2 equivalency due to industrialized agriculture is very hard to measure and as you can imagine it is a controversial topic. These are some of the most conservative estimates coming from a trusted source. A detailed list about the problems caused by industrialized agriculture as well as a video can be found at the factory farming awareness coalition website(<a href=https://www.ffacoalition.org/ id="link">See https://ffacoalition.org</a>). Regardless of the exact numbers, clearly industrialized agriculture plays a major role in the climate crisis and it is something all of us can play a major role in changing. </p>

					</figure>
					<p>Most farm-related emissions come in the form of methane (cows burping- and large feces pits) and nitrous oxide (synthetic fertilizers) which as I pointed out in the last slide has a much greater effect on thickening the greenhouse gas layer. But it’s also the transportation and energy used in the process of raising and processing meat and the food they need.</p>
					<p>Large deforestation is happening around the world to make room for more corn and soybeans for cattle feed as well as industrialized growing of palm oil, and more land for raising livestock.  This decreases the CO2 absorption that trees provide, so it’s really important that we’re not taking down the trees in the Amazon and around the world.</p>

								<li>10.Buy Less</li>
							</ul>
						</div>

					<p>So what can you personally do?</p>
					<p>Environmentalist Paul Hawken has gathered scientists around the world to measure and model the most substantive solutions to stop global warming, and he has a book called Drawdown and a website called Drawdown.org (See <a href=http://drawdown.org id="link">http:/drawdown,org/</a>) where he goes into detail about the most productive things we can do in order of greatest impact for the least cost. In other words, a cost benefit analysis. The list you see here is a subset of his list that individuals can do.</p>
					<p>Lets focus on number 2.</p>

					<h2>What do all these World Famous Athletes have in Common</h2>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/Famous_Athletes.jpg" alt=" World Famous Athletes"  class="center"/>
					</figure>
					<p>What do all these famous athletes have in common? They are all vegans.</p>
					<p>There are many other vegan athletes that I could have chosen, but I chose these 6 because I wanted to select ones I knew you would recognize. Many vegan athletes weren’t vegan when they first entered their field, but after choosing a vegan diet they found their performance excelled. So it’s not just a health or environmentally conscious choice. By the way the movie “Game Changer” which can be found on Netflix as well as other platforms illustrates this issue.</p>

					<h2>Pounds of CO2 per Serving</h2>			
					<h3>(4 oz Meat, 1/2 C Asparagus & Carrots, 8 oz Liquids</h3>	
					<figure>
						<img src="images/Pds_CO2_PP.jpg" alt="Pounds of CO2 per Serving" class="center" />
					</figure>
					<p>So as you can see meat and dairy are the clear leaders.</p>

					<h2>Animal Based Foods Are More Resource Intensive than Plant Based Foods</h2>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/Animal_Foods_Resorce.jpg" alt="Graph of Animal & Plant Based Foods" class="center" />
					</figure>
					<p>It’s not only greenhouse gas emissions, meat and dairy also use more land and water, as you can see in this graph.</p>

					<h2>Some Proteins Are Better Than Others</h2>			
					<h3>For the Health of the Planet and the Population</h3>	
					<figure>
						<img src="images/Protein_Compare.jpg" alt="Graph" class="center" />
					</figure>
					<p>On the left is the reduced risk of death compared to eating red meat. On the right we compare the CO2 equivalent to produce the same quantity of protein from different food sources. Now I know I’m not going to convince you all to become vegans, but even eating less meat can make a big difference.<p/>

					<h2>Growth of Plant-Based Foods Market</h2>
					<figure>
						<img src="images/Growth_PBFoods.jpg" alt="Graph of Growth in Plant Based Foods" class="center" />
					</figure>
                    <p>Luckily, Americans are already starting to make this change. Over 100 million Americans report eating more plant-based protein. Plant-based foods are one of the fastest growing sectors of the food industry. While there are an increasing number of vegetarians and vegans, this change is largely being driven by part-time vegetarians. Have you tried eating Beyond Meat burgers or Impossible burgers? And there are many other plant based meat alternatives for all kinds of meat as well as dairy.</p>

					<h2>Your World depends on it.</h2>
                    <p>The truth is we all have to do our part to conquer the climate crisis. So, are you ready to do your part for our planet?</p>
